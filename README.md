# config-engine

**config-engine** is my personal infrastructure automation toolkit, and an evolving record of how Iâ€™m learning to design, build, and maintain real-world configuration management and deployment workflows.

This project is where I design, test, and refine reusable, version-controlled playbooks, templates, and roles for setting up and managing servers and services consistently, from scratch lab setups to production-ready patterns.

I focus on building reliable, idempotent workflows that turn complex manual tasks into clear, repeatable automation. Some of the core areas I cover:

- Automated configuration management using Ansible roles, dynamic templates, handlers, and variables
- DNS, web server, and firewall orchestration for both lab environments and real-world scenarios
- Secure certificate generation, virtual host management, and repeatable provisioning
- A solid foundation for future CI/CD pipelines and cloud-native workflows

**Why this exists:** `config-engine` is my single source of truth. My space to practice, experiment, and share real, tested automation that replaces manual server setup with confidence and clarity.
